# Religious fallacies examples in numbers

Across religious debates, arguments are thrown left and right without much quantification, which makes the discussion
very counter productive. Therefore, I have setup this repository as a collection of examples.

It consists of both the raw data (or how to get it) and ways to plot it.

Feel free to contibute and/or suggest any changes.
